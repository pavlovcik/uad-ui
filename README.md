# Ubiquity Dollar

Introducing the flagship product of [Ubiquity DAO](https://ubq.fi/). Ubiquity's Algorithmic Dollar (uAD) is an algorithmic stablecoin that maintains its peg by virtue of its monetary and fiscal policies.

The deployed smart contracts can be found in the [docs](https://dao.ubq.fi/smart-contracts).

## Metamask Development Wallet Setup

### Network Settings

Make sure you are using the following network configuration:

- `31337` chain ID of the Hardhat network.
- `http://127.0.0.1:8545` RPC endpoin of the Hardhat network.

### Shared Private Keys

- All Hardhat developers know about these keys. These keys are derived from the `test test test test test test test test test test test junk` mnemonic in the Hardhat docs.
- Do not send assets of value to these wallets.

### Ubiquity Dollar Contracts Setup

This section is for the Ubiquity Dollar core protocol smart contracts (not the UbiquiStick NFT or UI related code.)

You need to create `.env` file inside the contracts folder with at least the `API_KEY_ALCHEMY` and the `MNEMONIC` filled. Indeed `MNEMONIC` will be used to deploy locally and the first account will be the admin on all the smart contracts.

Run the faucet to get tokens to your address. You will need the `UAD_MANAGER_ADDRESS` that you can find in the output of the `yarn start`

```bash
YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS= # enter address here
UAD_MANAGER_ADDRESS= # enter address here
yarn hardhat --network localhost faucet --receiver $YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS --manager $UAD_MANAGER_ADDRESS
```

Sine stabilitate nihil habemus.
